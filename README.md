Titanic Dataset:Data Analysis
In this notebook, we're going to analyse the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is meant for supervised machine learning

We'll try to answer the following questions:

Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc)
What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
Where did the passengers come from?
Who was alone and who was with family?
What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

 Predict= if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 
For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.
